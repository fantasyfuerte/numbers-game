# CocoGuess 🎉

A simple multiplayer game where you have to guess a secret number thought by another player. The first one to guess wins! 🏆

Technologies used:

- Next.js ⚡️ as the frontend framework
- Socket.IO 📡 for real-time communication between clients and the server
- Tailwind CSS 🎨 for styling
- TypeScript 🦄 for type safety

How to play:

1. Create a new game or join an existing one using a code
2. Think of a 4-digit number and submit it
3. The other player will try to guess your number
4. You will see the other player's guesses and can respond with a hint (e.g. "too high" or "too low")
5. The first player to guess the other player's number wins! 🎉

Have fun playing! 😄
